[2025-04-21 18:16:15] Current Focus: Completed initial MVP across all planned phases (Core Orchestration, Collaboration, Planning/Memory, Extensibility/UI). The basic framework is in place with placeholder implementations for key components.
[2025-04-21 18:16:15] Recent Changes: Implemented basic LLM interface, task management, agent abstraction, simple orchestrator, inter-agent communication, task decomposition with dependency tracking, evaluation framework, basic feedback loops, planning, memory, knowledge base, plugin manager, and a CLI.
[2025-04-21 18:16:15] Open Questions/Issues: The current implementations are placeholders and require significant further development to achieve the full project goals. Need to replace dummy components with real LLM integrations, implement sophisticated planning and memory, and build a more robust UI. The import errors encountered during the CLI execution have been addressed.
[2025-04-25 18:14:41] Recent Changes: Replaced GenericLLMConnector with actual GoogleGeminiConnector and OpenAIChatGPTConnector in simple_orchestrator example usage and relevant test files.
[2025-04-25 18:16:49] Recent Changes: Integrated GoogleGeminiConnector and OpenAIChatGPTConnector into main.py for agent instantiation.
[2025-04-25 18:21:21] Recent Changes: Integrated BasicPlanner into SimpleOrchestrator and updated main.py to process high-level goals using the planner.
[2025-04-25 18:27:00] Recent Changes: Enhanced BasicPlanner to use an LLM for generating plans from high-level goals.
[2025-04-25 18:34:36] Recent Changes: Enhanced SQLiteMemory search functionality to optionally use an LLM for generating search terms.
[2025-04-25 18:36:29] Recent Changes: Implemented a basic consolidate method in SQLiteMemory, with optional LLM integration for strategy suggestions.
[2025-04-25 18:40:14] Recent Changes: Enhanced the main CLI in main.py with basic command parsing and improved output.
[2025-04-25 18:47:39] Recent Changes: Added 'list tasks' and 'search memory' commands to the main CLI in main.py.
