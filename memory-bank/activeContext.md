[2025-04-21 18:16:15] Current Focus: Completed initial MVP across all planned phases (Core Orchestration, Collaboration, Planning/Memory, Extensibility/UI). The basic framework is in place with placeholder implementations for key components.
[2025-04-21 18:16:15] Recent Changes: Implemented basic LLM interface, task management, agent abstraction, simple orchestrator, inter-agent communication, task decomposition with dependency tracking, evaluation framework, basic feedback loops, planning, memory, knowledge base, plugin manager, and a CLI.
[2025-04-21 18:16:15] Open Questions/Issues: The current implementations are placeholders and require significant further development to achieve the full project goals. Need to replace dummy components with real LLM integrations, implement sophisticated planning and memory, and build a more robust UI. The import errors encountered during the CLI execution have been addressed.
